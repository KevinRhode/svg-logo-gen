## User Story
AS a freelance web developer  
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects  
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I am prompted for text  
THEN I can enter up to three characters  
WHEN I am prompted for the text color  
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)  
WHEN I am prompted for a shape  
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square  
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color  
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)  
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts  
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`  
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line  
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser  
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered  

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
